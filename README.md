### A web app for helping my girlfriend find a place to eat.

Built with 
- React 
- MaterialUI
- Emotion
- Yelp Fusion API
  
<hr />

Originally built with Vue + Vuetify, this has been updated! It now has a proper backend configuration where I was once using a sketchy proxy configuration to bypass Yelp's CORS policy. I also feel the UI has been enhanced greatly. 

#### Can I copy this?
Uh, if you want. All you need is a .env in the server folder with your Yelp API key. Then install server and client dependencies and run `yarn dev`. Give credit if you do!

#### Is this maintained?
If this repository is ever updated it will probably be a large scale re-write when I remember how bad my past self was at coding.

#### Misc.
Took approximately long to make as it takes my girlfriend to pick a place. (Don't tell her I said that.)
